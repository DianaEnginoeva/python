Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.

Scrapy's requests are scheduled and processed asynchronously. This means that Scrapy doesnâ€™t need to wait for a request to be finished and processed, it can send another request or do other things in the meantime. This also means that other requests can keep going even if some request fails or an error happens while handling it.

Installation:
1. pip3 install requests
2. -a Finder /usr/local/bin (check)
